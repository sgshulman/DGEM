A simple three-dimensional dust continuum radiative transfer code demonstrating directions grid enumeration method advantages.
The method was described in [Shulman (2018)](#shulman2018).

This code is based on mcpolar program by Kenneth Wood (http://www-star.st-and.ac.uk/~kw25/research/montecarlo/montecarlo.html). The code was translated from FORTRAN to C++, refactored and improved. Now it realizes two radiative transfer techniques: Monte Carlo method and directions grid enumeration method (DGEM). DGEM uses precalculated directions of the photons propagation instead of the random ones to speed up the calculations process.

The physics and method detail will be presented in a paper which is in preparation now.

The provided makefile allows compiling the program on Linux.
Cmake configuration can be used to build the program and for IDEs.

PLOT3.plt is a gnuplot script for plotting the resulting images.

A utility for results comparison is differ. It is in a directory differ. Compiled differ utility requires two filenames as command arguments. The difference is called "refsum".

## DGEM configuration
The program use parameters.json configuration file with following sections:

### Method Parameters

Common settings
- fMonteCarlo &mdash; is True or False. Set False for using DGEM or set True for using Monte Carlo method
- taumin &mdash; is the minimum optical depth which gives scatterings
- nscat &mdash; number of scatterings considered

Monte Carlo parameters
- nphotons &mdash; total number of photon packets for Monte Carlo method
- iseed &mdash; initialization parameter for random number generator in Monte Carlo method

DGEM parameters
- PrimaryDirectionsLevel &mdash; primary directions number is 5 * 4 ^ PrimaryDirectionsLevel
- SecondaryDirectionsLevel &mdash; primary directions number is 5 * 4 ^ SecondaryDirectionsLevel
- NumOfPrimaryScatterings &mdash; number of scatterings in every direction in the primary grid
- NumOfSecondaryScatterings &mdash; number of scatterings in every direction in secondary grid
- MonteCarloStart &mdash; number of scatterings of the photon package after which Monte Carlo
                            method is used instead of DGEM (1 is recommended)

### Dust

DGEM supports two types of dust now.
- kappa &mdash; The extinction opacity. It is the common dust parameter.

The second Dust description part is "white" or "mie" section.

"white" section corresponds to the dust with [Henyey and Greenstein (1941)](#henyey1941) phase function and
[White (1979)](#white1979) approximation for polarization functions.
It is described by the following parameters:
- albedo &mdash; Single scattering albedo
- hgg &mdash; Henyey-Greenstein phase function anisotropy
- pl &mdash; Peak linear polarization
- pc &mdash; Peak circular polarization
- sc &mdash; Skew Factor

"mie" section describes the dust with tabulated scattering matrix coefficients.
They are usually calculated based on Mie theory.
There are two parameters:
- albedo &mdash; Single scattering albedo
- tableFile &mdash; the path of a file with elements of scattering matrix for Stokes vector (I_r, I_l, U, V). Each line of the file contains a scattering angle in degrees and four coefficients: p1, p2, p3, and p4.

### Geometry

The geometry of the scattering matter is described as a set of geometric shapes. 
On the top level, there are should be flared disk, sphere envelope, fractal cloud or max/sum list.
All angles of this section are measured in degrees, all distances are supposed to be in astronomy units.

#### Flared Disk

The density of the flared disk is described by the following formulae:

![flared disk](./docs_src/images/flared_disk.svg)

where the scale height

![flared disk height](./docs_src/images/flared_disk_h.svg)

and the radial coordinate in the disk plane

![flared disk radius](./docs_src/images/flared_disk_r.svg).

The model parameters are:
- rInner &mdash; the inner disk radius
- rOuter &mdash; the outer disk radius
- rho0 &mdash; the density at the disk midplane at a radius r0
- h0 &mdash; the disk scale height at a radius r0
- r0 &mdash; the radius, where h0 and rho0 are defined
- alpha &mdash; the radial density exponent
- beta &mdash; the flaring power

##### Safier Wind

One can add the disk wind to the flared disk.
The wind model was suggested by Safier ([1993a](#safier1993a), [1993b](#safier1993b)).
The density of the disk with the wind is the maximum of the wind and disk densities.
The density of the Safier wind is
 
![safier wind](./docs_src/images/safier_wind.svg)

where _&chi; = z / r_ is the dimensionless height above the disk plane and _&rho;<sub>0</sub>_ is the wind density on
the disk surface at distance 1 AU from the star.

![safier wind](./docs_src/images/safier_wind_rho0.svg)

The function _&eta;(&chi;)_ can be obtained by solving the gas-dynamic equations.
_&xi;'<sub>0</sub>_ and _&psi;<sub>0</sub>_ are wind model parameters, which are defined in Safier papers ([1993a](#safier1993a), [1993b](#safier1993b)) for a list of models.

The parameters of the wind are:
- model &mdash; the model of the wind from Safier papers. Should be B, C, D, I, E, F or G
- mOut &mdash; the mass outflow rate in solar masses per year
- mStar &mdash; the stellar mass in solar masses
- h0 &mdash; the dimensionless height from which the wind begins
- rMin &mdash; the inner radius of the wind formation region
- rMax &mdash; the outer radius of the wind formation region

##### Disk Humps

One can add humps based on the Gaussian function to model disk perturbations.
There are two types of humps: a round hump and an azimuthal hump.
Both humps may be applied to the flared disk and Safier wind.
In the case of the disk hump, it is applied to the disk scale height _h_.
In the case of the wind hump it is applied to the density _&rho;_.
Only one hump is allowed for the disk (or wind).
The hump centre is located on the _x_ axis of the disk.

The round hump has a shape

![round hump](./docs_src/images/round_hump.svg)

The azimuthal hump has a bit more complicated shape

![azimuthal hump](./docs_src/images/azimuthal_hump.svg)

In this equations _v_ is the value the hump changes and other values are hump model parameters:
- h &mdash; the hump relative height
- r &mdash; the distance from the disk axis to the centre of the hump
- sigma2 &mdash; the variance of the hump mass distribution along the disk plane (for the round hump) or the radius (for azimuthal hump)
- rMax &mdash; the variance of the hump mass distribution along the azimuth for azimuthal hump.

#### Sphere Envelope

The density of the sphere envelope is described by the equation

![sphere envelope](./docs_src/images/sphere_envelope.svg)

where the radius is
    
![sphere envelope radius](./docs_src/images/sphere_envelope_r.svg).

The model parameters are:
- rInner &mdash; the inner sphere radius
- rOuter &mdash; the outer sphere radius
- rho0 &mdash; the density at a radius r0
- r0 &mdash; the radius, where rho0 is defined
- alpha &mdash; the radial density exponent

#### Fractal Cloud

The fractal cloud suggested by [Elmegreen (1997)](#elmegreen1997) is a clumpy dust cloud, which is obtained by the following algorithm:
1. Consider a cube space with size **2max**, consisting of **n**<sup>3</sup> cubical cells.
2. Place **dotsN** points randomly in the cube. 
3. For every point build a smaller cub with a center in the point. The size of
new cubes is **max**/&Delta;, where &Delta; = **dotsN<sup>1/dCube</sup>**.
**dCube** is the fractal dimension.
4. Place other **dotsN** points randomly in every small cube.
Do not shift any points outside of the considered big cube and use them in the next steps.
5. Repeat steps 3â€“4 twice more. The total number of created points is **dotsN**<sup>4</sup>.
6. Shift all points outside the big cube to within it by changing point coordinates per **2max**.
7. Set the density in every cell proportional to the number of dots in this cell

The model parameters are:
- n &mdash; the number of cells along each direction of the cube.
- max &mdash; the distance from the cube centre to a cube border along each axis
- dCube &mdash; the fractal dimension
- rho0 &mdash; the density per one dot
- dotsN &mdash; the number of initial dots
- seed &mdash; the seed for a random number generator

#### Sum / Max

The list of other geometry shapes (including other lists).
The density of the sum list is the sum of densities of all elements.
The density of the max list is the maximum density of all elements.

#### Translation

The Flared Disk and the Sphere Envelope may contain additional Translation section.
It describes a rotation and a translation of the shape in the global coordinate system.
We use the Euler angles for rotation.
So there are six parameters: intrinsicRotation, nutation, precession, x, y, z.
All transformations are applied in the global coordinate system, thus the order of operations is:
1. Intrinsic Rotation (rotation around _z_-axis)
2. Nutation (rotation around _x_-axis)
3. Precession (rotation around _z_-axis)
4. (x, y, z) vector translation

Every value may be omitted (it will be treated as zero).

### Grid

Two types of grids are supported: a regular cartesian grid and an unstructured tetrahedral grid.

#### Cartesian grid

The cartesian grid has following parameters __xmax__, __ymax__, __zmax__, __nx__, __ny__, and __nz__.
The studied area is [__-xmax__ : __xmax__] x  [__-ymax__ : __ymax__] x [__-zmax__ : __zmax__] and consists of __nx * ny * nz__ cells.
__nx__, __ny__, and __nz__ are the numbers of cells along each axis.

#### Tetrahedral grid

The tetrahedral grid is based on the Delaunay triangulation.
The area is from __-max__ to __max__ along all axes.
The nodes of the grid are described in the __nodesFile__ and elements are listed in __elementsFile__.
Instead of these two files the grid may be presented in the form of one binary file __gridBinFile__.
If all three files exist, grid from __nodesFile__ and __elementsFile__ will be saved in __gridBinFile__.
The grid may be constructed in a separate programs, e.g. [_gmsh_](https://gmsh.info/) ([Geuzaine and  Remacle, 2009](#geuzaine2009))

The first line of the __nodesFile__ is the number of nodes. All other lines contain four values: node number and _x_, _y_, _z_ coordinates.

The first line of the __elementsFile__ is the number of nodes. All other lines contain five unused values and four node numbers of the tetrahedral vertices.

### Stars
Is a list of sources with 4 parameters:
- x, y, z &mdash; source coordinates
- l &mdash; source luminosity

```yaml
"stars": [
    {
      "x": 0.0,
      "y": 0.0,
      "z": 0.0,
      "l": 1.0
    }
  ]
```

### Observers

We use spherical coordinates [_&theta;_, _&phi;_] to describe the direction towards each observer.
_&theta;_ is a zenith distance (an angle between positive _z_-axis direction and observers direction), measured from 0 to 180&deg;.
_&phi;_ is an azimuth, measured counterclockwise in _xy_ plane from the positive _x_-axis direction.
The azimuth may be in the range from -180&deg; to 180&deg; or from 0 to 360&deg;.

The third parameter of the observer is _rimage_.
It is a radius of the visible area in astronomy units.
Both axes of the image will be from -_rimage_ to _rimage_.
We specify _rimage_ once for all observers.

There are three ways to specify observer directions:

#### Manual

One should specify the list of coordinates _&phi;_ and _&theta;_ for each observer position.

#### Parallel

All observers are evenly distributed on the circle with a constant _&theta;_.
In this configuration, one should specify the number of observers _numberOfObservers_ and _&theta;_.
The first observer has _&phi;_ equal to zero.

#### Meridian

All observers are evenly distributed on the meridian with a constant _&phi;_.
In this configuration, one should specify the number of observers _numberOfObservers_ and _&phi;_.
If _numberOfObservers_ is the odd one of the observers has _&theta;_ equal to 90&deg;.
This configuration does not include poles.

#### Example

You can combine all three ways in one problem.
The JSON configuration may be specified in the following way:

```yaml
"observers": {
    "rimage": 800.0,
    "manual": [
      {
        "phi": 45.0,
        "theta": 45.0
      },
      {
        "phi": 60.0,
        "theta": 120.0
      }
    ],
    "parallel": {
      "numberOfObservers" : 10,
      "theta" : 90.0
    },
    "meridian": {
      "numberOfObservers" : 2,
      "phi" : 0.0
    }
  }
```
